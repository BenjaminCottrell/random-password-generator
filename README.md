# random-password-generator

## Description

This project was built to see how to take an input from a user and utilize it in JS to create a random string of numbers, letters and special characters as a randomly generated password. 
This solves the issue of having to come up with strong passwords on your own. You only need to then store the password safely. 
I learned how to create a while loop that checks whether an input is valid or invalid, as well as learning how to create a random number generator with a loop to create a string of characters. This was achieved after user input defined what type of characters would be combined to make said string. 

The following User Story and Acceptance Criteria were outlined for this project:

### User Story

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
